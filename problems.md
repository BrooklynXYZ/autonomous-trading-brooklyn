i didn't apply all your patch.. Make sure to re-scan the code to see the last version i made edits... It works this way perfectly, Now there's few issues

1. we got the volume working!  in calculateIndicatorsStep i see:
{
  "ethIndicators": {
    "rsi": 51.49843990934681,
    "ema21": 3705.6703474851647,
    "bollinger": {
      "upper": 3763.408350458304,
      "lower": 3633.754865197001,
      "middle": 3698.5816078276525,
      "position": "middle"
    },
    "price_change_24h": -0.017836774910203617,
    "volume_ratio": 1.937891009847074
  },
  "solIndicators": {
    "rsi": 54.001595436698345,
    "ema21": 199.33926241880812,
    "bollinger": {
      "upper": 204.33472378397875,
      "lower": 195.57718865468638,
      "middle": 199.95595621933256,
      "position": "middle"
    },
    "price_change_24h": 0.026874065392859945,
    "volume_ratio": 3.867476801186535
  }
}

BUT we never included it in the next step formatMarketSummaryStep therefore the LLM never sees it .....

2. we got the trades finally working in the step fetch protofile... then in the format step i see:
{
  "ethSummary": "ETH Market Summary:\n- RSI: 51.50\n- EMA(21): 3705.67\n- Bollinger: [middle] (U:3763.41, L:3633.75)\n- 24h Change: -1.78%\n",

    }
  ]
}


it's very unaccurate !!! first of all we're only trading ETH or SOL this trade is WETH , we're only interested in telling the LLM here's an ETH/SOL open trade do you want to close it, Hold, Or sell .... how do we know there's even an open trade?? We can assume the during the trading we will always have either 0 ETH = no open trades or  ETH !=0  ==> we own some ETH we start tracking to find the last ETH trade made and get it's timestamp then we can calc the profit/loss and make sure the LLM see it 

this needs to be done for both ETH and SOL also we need to make a filter where if we're in the ETH descion step don't show sol data to the LLM
